As part of my enrollment in the online software engineering course at FlatIron school, I am required to write a blog article as to why I am interested in web development/software engineering. 
      My interest in web development sparked many years ago when an acquaintance of mine was looking for someone to build a basic website for his startup company that he was trying to start in India. He wanted a website which describes his company and link to submit a resume by the prospective employees. He wanted that resume to be stored in a database. So began my adventures in the world of web development. I used the resources available on world wide web, for HTML & CSS and used the book (PHP, Apache, MySQL) provided my acquaintance. The website I built was very basic and met the requirements that my acquaintance requested. It looked very boring (as my acquaintance did not care for design aspect), but it served its purpose. Although my interest was sparked long time ago, I did not dive into web development until recently. This year I decided to enroll in a web development course at Udemy and after finishing the course I thought it was time I invest in a Boot Camp to build a strong foundation and one that offers career services. And here I am, to begin a new adventure.
